The packages can be installed from CRAN or Github or Bioconductor: install.packages(c(&quot;ggplot2&quot;,&quot;dplyr&quot;,&quot;gprofiler2&quot;,&quot;imager&quot;,&quot;magick&quot;,&quot;tibble&quot;,&quot;MASS&quot;,&quot;tidyr&quot;,&quot;stringr&quot;)) if (!require(&quot;BiocManager&quot;, quietly = TRUE)) install.packages(&quot;BiocManager&quot;) BiocManager::install(c(&quot;DESeq2&quot;,&quot;clusterProfiler&quot;)) Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading #. To compile this example to PDF, you need XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.name/tinytex/. "],["intro.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction", " Chapter 2 Introduction You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter 2. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter ??. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 2.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 2.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 2.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 2.1: Here is a nice table!

These are resuable. myvar &lt;- 5 print(myvar) ## [1] 5 myvar &lt;- &quot;Hello, World!&quot; print(myvar) ## [1] &quot;Hello, World!&quot; You can see the same variable myvar stores the value 5 and later gets replaced by Hello, World! 3.2 R-objects Although you can make vectors manually using the c() function, there are also some specialised functions for making vectors. The seq() function can be used to make up arithmetic series of values. The rep() function simply repeats a value a specified number of times. special operator : for creating vectors of sequential integers seq(from=1,to=5,by=0.5) ## [1] 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0 rep(&quot;hello!&quot;,5) ## [1] &quot;hello!&quot; &quot;hello!&quot; &quot;hello!&quot; &quot;hello!&quot; &quot;hello!&quot; 15:25 ## [1] 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 c(rep(1,3),rep(&quot;hello!&quot;,3),rep(3,3)) ## [1] &quot;1&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;hello!&quot; &quot;hello!&quot; &quot;hello!&quot; &quot;3&quot; &quot;3&quot; ## [9] &quot;3&quot; 3.2.1 Accessing Vector Subsets One can access specific positions in a vector in various ways myvec &lt;- c(rep(1,3),rep(&quot;hello!&quot;,3),rep(3,3)) myvec[4] ## [1] &quot;hello!&quot; myvec[4:7] ## [1] &quot;hello!&quot; &quot;hello!&quot; &quot;hello!&quot; &quot;3&quot; myvec[c(4,9)] ## [1] &quot;hello!&quot; &quot;3&quot; 3.2.2 Named Vectors In all R data structures you have the option of assigning names to numeric positions so that you can use the name to access the data instead of the position. myobj &lt;- 11:15 names(myobj) &lt;- c(&quot;pos1&quot;,&quot;pos2&quot;,&quot;pos3&quot;,&quot;pos4&quot;,&quot;pos5&quot;) myobj ## pos1 pos2 pos3 pos4 pos5 ## 11 12 13 14 15 myobj[c(&quot;pos2&quot;,&quot;pos5&quot;,&quot;pos1&quot;)] ## pos2 pos5 pos1 ## 12 15 11 "],["day-1-practice.html", "Chapter 4 Day 1 Practice 4.1 Exercise 1: Simple Calculations", " Chapter 4 Day 1 Practice 4.1 Exercise 1: Simple Calculations Use R to calculate the following: 31 * 78 697 / 41 Assign the value of 39 to x Assign the value of 22 to y Exercise 2: Working with Vectors - Create a vector called newvec with 20 elements - add names to the elements - retrieve 1st 5 elements - retrieve any 3 elements by name Exercise 3: Lists and Data Frames Exercise 4: Reading &amp; Writing Exercise 5: Filtering Exercise 6: Plots Exercise 7: Tests "],["day-2.html", "Chapter 5 Day 2 5.1 Example one 5.2 Example two", " Chapter 5 Day 2 Some significant applications are demonstrated in this chapter. 5.1 Example one 5.2 Example two "],["day-2-practice.html", "Chapter 6 Day 2 Practice", " Chapter 6 Day 2 Practice We have finished a nice book.
